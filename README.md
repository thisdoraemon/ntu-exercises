# Java OOP Exercises from NTU

This repository contains all of the exercises from the Java OOP course at [NTU](https://www3.ntu.edu.sg/home/ehchua/programming/java/J3f_OOPExercises.html), as well as some additional exercises that I have added. I am currently working on solving all of the exercises, and I will keep adding more as I finish them.

## Instructions

1. To run the exercises, simply clone the repository:
   ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/thisdoraemon/ntu-exercises
   ```
2. Then, you can go to the `src/` folder and look for my solution to your current problem.
   
3. I have already separated all of the problems into `App` and `Data` packages, where `App` contains the main method and `Data` contains all of the classes needed for each problem.

## Additional Exercises

In addition to the exercises from the NTU course, I have also added some additional exercises to this repository. These exercises are designed to challenge students and help them to learn more about Java OOP concepts.

## Contributing

If you have any additional exercises that you would like to add to this repository, please feel free to submit a pull request. I am always looking for new and challenging exercises to add to the collection.
